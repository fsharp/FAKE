# Getting started with FAKE - F# Make

**Note:  This documentation is for FAKE.exe version 5.0 or later. The old documentation can be found [here](legacy-gettingstarted.html)**

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up a complete build infrastructure with "FAKE - F# Make". This includes:

* how to install the latest FAKE version
* how to edit and run scripts
* how to automatically compile your C# or F# projects
* how to automatically run NUnit tests on your projects

## Install FAKE

"FAKE - F# Make" is completely written in F# and all build scripts will also be written in F#, but this doesn't imply that you have to learn programming in F#. In fact the "FAKE - F# Make" syntax is hopefully very easy to learn.

There are various ways to install FAKE 5

* Install the 'fake' or 'fake-netcore' package for you system (currenty chocolatey)
  Example `choco install fake -pre`

* Use it as dotnet tool: Add `<DotNetCliToolReference Include="dotnet-fake" Version="5.0.0*" />` to your dependencies and run `dotnet fake ...` instead of `fake ...`, see [this example](https://github.com/matthid/fake-bootstrap/blob/master/dotnet-fake.csproj)

* Bootstrap via shell script (fake.cmd/fake.sh),
  see this [example project](https://github.com/matthid/fake-bootstrap)

  > DISCLAIMER: These scripts have no versioning story. You either need to take care of versions yourself (and lock them) or your builds might break on major releases.

## Create and Edit scripts with Intellisense

Once `fake` is available you can start creating your script:

* Create a new file `myscript.fsx` with the following contents:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.Core.Target prerelease"
#load "./.fake/myscript.fsx/intellisense.fsx"
```

> Note: `storage: none` is currently required because of a bug, but it will be added by default.

Where you can add all the [fake modules](fake-fake5-modules.html) you need.

* run the script to restore your dependencies and setup the intellisense support: `fake run myscript.fsx`.
  This might take some seconds depending on your internet connection

  > The warning `FS0988: Main module of program is empty: nothing will happen when it is run` indicates that you have not written any code into the script yet.

* now open the script in VS Code with ionide-fsharp extension or Visual Studio.

> Note: If you change your dependencies you need to delete `myscript.fsx.lock` and run the script again for intellisense to update.
> Note: Intellisense is shown for the full framework while the script is run as `netcoreapp20` therefore intellisense might show APIs which are not actually usable.

## Example - Compiling and building your .NET application

This example will guide you by adding a fake script to your existing .NET application.

### Getting started

Initially we need to create a file called `build.fsx` where our build-logic will have its home.
Create a new file with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (with ionide) and paste the following content:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"
```

This is all we need for now to declare that we need the `Fake.Core.Target` module and want to enable intellisense.

Now run `fake run build.fsx` to make fake prepare our environment. Now our IDE can load the dependencies and will have intellisense enabled (you might need to reopen the script file on some Editors).

Now that we have setup our basic environment to edit the script file we add our first target:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

open Fake.Core

// Default target
Target.create "Default" (fun _ ->
  Trace.trace "Hello World from FAKE"
)

// start build
Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```

As you can see the code is really simple. The few first lines (`nuget Fake.Core.Target` and `open Fake.Core`) load the fake modules we need and is vital for all build scripts to support creating and running targets. The `#load` line is optional but a good way to make the IDE aware of all the modules (for intellisense and IDE support)

After this header the *Default* target is defined. A target definition contains two important parts. The first is the name of the target (here "Default") and the second is an action (here a simple trace of "Hello world").

The last line runs the "Default" target - which means it executes the defined action of the target.

Try running your new target via `fake run build.fsx` or the shortcut for a file called `build.fsx`: `fake build`

### Cleaning the last build output

A typical first step in most build scenarios is to clean the output of the last build. We can achieve this in two steps:

First change your header to the following by adding the `Fake.IO.FileSystem` module:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.IO.FileSystem
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"
```

Now we remove the `build.fsx.lock` file and run `fake build` in order to restore the newly added `Fake.IO.FileSystem` module.

As we can now work with intellisense we can easily discover the various modules and functions in `Fake.IO`, for example the `Shell` module provides various functions you expect from regular shell scripting, but we use `Shell.CleanDir` which will ensure the given directory is empty by deleting everything within or creating the directory if required:

> Hint: you can explore the APIs for example by writing `Fake.IO.` and waiting for intellisense (or pressing `Strg+Space`).
> You can remove `Fake.IO` once you put `open Fake.IO` on top.

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.IO.FileSystem
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

open Fake.Core
open Fake.IO

// Properties
let buildDir = "./build/"

// Targets
Target.create "Clean" (fun _ ->
  Shell.CleanDir buildDir
)

Target.create "Default" (fun _ ->
  Trace.trace "Hello World from FAKE"
)

// Dependencies
open Fake.Core.TargetOperators

"Clean"
  ==> "Default"

// start build
Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```

We introduced some new concepts in this snippet. At first we defined a global property called `buildDir` with the relative path of a temporary build folder.

In the `Clean` target we use the `Shell.CleanDir` task to clean up this build directory. As explained above this simply deletes all files in the folder or creates the directory if necessary.

In the dependencies section we say that the *Default* target has a dependency on the *Clean* target. In other words *Clean* is a prerequisite of *Default* and will be run before the execution of *Default*:

### Compiling the application

In the next step we want to compile our C# libraries, which means we want to compile all csproj-files under */src/app* with MSBuild.

Again we need some new module for this, namely `Fake.DotNet.MSBuild`.

Just like before add the required module on top via `nuget Fake.DotNet.MSBuild`, delete the `build.fsx.lock` file and run the script.
Now edit the script like this:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.IO.FileSystem
nuget Fake.DotNet.MSBuild
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

open Fake.IO
open Fake.IO.Globbing.Operators //enables !! and globbing
open Fake.DotNet
open Fake.Core

// Properties
let buildDir = "./build/"

// Targets
Target.create "Clean" (fun _ ->
  Shell.CleanDir buildDir
)

Target.create "BuildApp" (fun _ ->
  !! "src/app/**/*.csproj"
    |> MSBuild.runRelease buildDir "Build"
    |> Trace.Log "AppBuild-Output: "
)

Target.Create "Default" (fun _ ->
  Trace.trace "Hello World from FAKE"
)

open Fake.Core.TargetOperators

"Clean"
  ==> "BuildApp"
  ==> "Default"

// start build
Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```

We defined a new build target named "BuildApp" which compiles all csproj-files with the MSBuild task and the build output will be copied to `buildDir`.

In order to find the right project files FAKE scans the folder *src/app/* and all subfolders with the given pattern (the `!!` operator was imported from `Fake.IO.FileSystem` via `open Fake.IO.Globbing.Operators`). Therefore a similar FileSet definition like in NAnt or MSBuild (see [project page](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE) for details) is used.

In addition the target dependencies are extended again. Now *Default* is dependent on *BuildApp* and *BuildApp* needs *Clean* as a prerequisite.

This means the execution order is: Clean ==> BuildApp ==> Default.

![alt text](pics/gettingstarted/aftercompile.png "We introduced a Build target")

### Compiling test projects

Now our main application will be built automatically and it's time to build the test project. We use the same concepts as before:

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.IO.FileSystem
nuget Fake.DotNet.MSBuild
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/build.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

open Fake
open Fake.IO
open Fake.IO.Globbing.Operators
open Fake.DotNet
open Fake.Core


// Properties
let buildDir = "./build/"
let testDir  = "./test/"

// Targets
Target.create "Clean" (fun _ ->
  Shell.CleanDirs [buildDir; testDir]
)

Target.create "BuildApp" (fun _ ->
    !! "src/app/**/*.csproj"
    |> MSBuild.runRelease buildDir "Build"
    |> Trace.logItems "AppBuild-Output: "
)

Target.create "BuildTest" (fun _ ->
  !! "src/test/**/*.csproj"
    |> MSBuild.runDebug testDir "Build"
    |> Trace.logItems "TestBuild-Output: "
)

Target.create "Default" (fun _ ->
  Trace.trace "Hello World from FAKE"
)

open Fake.Core.TargetOperators
"Clean"
  ==> "BuildApp"
  ==> "BuildTest"
  ==> "Default"

// start build
Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```

This time we defined a new target "BuildTest" which compiles all C# projects below *src/test/* in Debug mode and we put the target into our build order.

### Running the tests with NUnit

Now all our projects will be compiled and we can use FAKE's NUnit task in order to let NUnit test our assembly (again we need a new module `Fake.DotNet.Testing.NUnit`):

```fsharp
#r "paket:
nuget Fake.IO.FileSystem
nuget Fake.DotNet.MSBuild
nuget Fake.DotNet.Testing.NUnit
nuget Fake.Core.Target //"
#load "./.fake/myscript.fsx/intellisense.fsx"

open Fake.IO
open Fake.IO.Globbing.Operators
open Fake.DotNet
open Fake.DotNet.Testing
open Fake.Core

// Properties
let buildDir = "./build/"
let testDir  = "./test/"

// Targets
Target.create "Clean" (fun _ ->
    Shell.CleanDirs [buildDir; testDir]
)

Target.create "BuildApp" (fun _ ->
   !! "src/app/**/*.csproj"
     |> MSBuild.runRelease buildDir "Build"
     |> Trace.logItems "AppBuild-Output: "
)

Target.create "BuildTest" (fun _ ->
    !! "src/test/**/*.csproj"
      |> MSBuild.runDebug testDir "Build"
      |> Trace.logItems "TestBuild-Output: "
)

Target.create "Test" (fun _ ->
    !! (testDir + "/NUnit.Test.*.dll")
      |> NUnit3.run (fun p ->
          {p with
                ShadowCopy = false })
)

Target.create "Default" (fun _ ->
    Trace.trace "Hello World from FAKE"
)

// Dependencies
open Fake.Core.TargetOperators
"Clean"
  ==> "BuildApp"
  ==> "BuildTest"
  ==> "Test"
  ==> "Default"

// start build
Target.runOrDefault "Default"
```

Our new *Test* target scans the test directory for test assemblies and runs them with the NUnit runner. FAKE automatically tries to locate the runner in one of your subfolders. See the [NUnit task documentation](apidocs/fake-nunitsequential.html) if you need to specify the tool path explicitly.

The mysterious part **(fun p -> ...)** simply overrides the default parameters of the NUnit task and allows to specify concrete parameters.
